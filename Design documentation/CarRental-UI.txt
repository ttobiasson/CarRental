User Interface
--------------

Simple UI with a start page that contains two buttons, one that takes the customer to a booking page, and one that takes 
the customer to a return page. On the booking page, the following information should be required.

#Personal identification number
#Vehicle Category
#Date of booking

There should exist a button named "book" that the customer presses when all the required information is entered.
When the button is pressed the customer should be presented with a "Thank you" message and 
their booking number and the date from when the booking is valid.
The price should be displayed upon return of the car since we cannot calculate the price 
without knowing exactly how far the customer will drive.

On the return car page, the following should be required information.

#Personal identification number
#Booking number
#Current mileage of the vehicle

When the customer has filled in this information, there should exist a button "Return vehicle" that when pressed
shows a nice message along with (at minimum) the price, booking number and personal identification number.
